description=[b]Spear pipeline for combat[/b]
description=
description=Streamlines spear combat by automatically swapping broken spears and quick-loading spears from inventory to your back. Spears break often and are heavy—this mod gives a spearfighter a smooth flow: inventory → back → hand.

description=[h2]Features[/h2]
description=- [b]Auto-swap on break[/b]: When your spear breaks, the mod drops it and equips the one from your back. Interruptible—spamming attack can cancel it, but you can still use your hotbar to equip.
description=- [b]Reload (R key)[/b]: Press R with a spear in hand to load one from main inventory onto your back. No inventory menu.
