description=[b]Spear pipeline for combat[/b]
description=
description=Streamlines spear combat by automatically swapping broken spears and quick-loading spears from inventory to your back. Spears break often and are heavy—this mod gives a spearfighter a smooth flow: inventory → back → hand.

description=[h2]Features[/h2]
description=- [b]Auto-swap on break[/b]: When your equipped spear breaks mid-combat, the mod drops it and equips the spear from your back slot
description=- [b]Reload (R key)[/b]: Press R while holding a spear to attach another from inventory to your back—no inventory menu
description=
description=[h2]Usage[/h2]
description=1. Equip a spear (both hands)
description=2. Attach a spare spear to your back (right-click → Attach to Back, or drag to back slot)
description=3. Fight—when your spear breaks, the mod auto-swaps
